# BruteForce-Attack-Simulation
This is a Brute Force Attack Simulator written in Python Programming Language, created for educational purposes.
This Project demonstrates how **simple brute-force attack**, **dictionary attack**, and **hybrid attack** work, along with **user management** where everyone can create, update, view and delete users.

## Features
1. **User Management**
   - Create, update, view and delete users
   - Usernames and Passwords are stored in a local text file (`user_database.txt`) 
2. **Simple Brute Force Attack**
   - Try all possible combinations of characters to crack a password and display *found password* 
3. **Simple Brute Force Attack (With Attempt Count)**
   - Track the number of attempts during the operation
4. **Dictionary Attack**
   - Attempt passswords from a wordlist (`dictionary_list.txt`)
5. **Hybrid Attack**
   - Combine dictionary attack with characters (digits and punctuation)
